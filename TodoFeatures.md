Sorting algorithms lie at the heart of order management. An efficient sorting algorithm implementation plays an important role on the system performance when the order numbers become large.

# New Features To-Do List #

  * Test data generation (random, almost sorted, and reversed)
  * Template the input data types and the comparator.
  * Use STL algorithms with function objects (functors) which provides better performance than function calls.
